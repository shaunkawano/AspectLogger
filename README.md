## AspectLogger

Simple aspect oriented annotation debugging library for Android development. Development started for the purpose of 'revealing' the causes of bugs and erorrs just by simple one annotation. Ironically, `@Reveal` to your methods only does measure their execution time for now.. 

(More functionality and usable annotations will be available in the future release.)

MainActivity
```java
    @Reveal
    private static void toJson() {
        String json = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            json = GSON.toJson(newObject());
        }
    }
```
logcat

```java
	V/AspectRevealerï¹• MainActivity#toJson :: [62 ms]
```

Hugely inspired by and finely minified version of [JakeWharton/hugo](https://github.com/JakeWharton/hugo).

## Todo

- [ ] Sync to mavenCentral
- [ ] Separate jars for annotation and library module
- [ ] Method parameter support to extend its toString()
