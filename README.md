## AspectLogger

Simple aspect oriented annotation debugging library for Android development. Development started for the purpose of 'revealing' the causes of bugs and erorrs just by simple one annotation. Ironically, `@Reveal` to your methods only does measure their execution time for now.. 

(More functionality and usable annotations will be available in the future release.)

MainActivity
```java
    @Reveal
    private static void toJson() {
        String json = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            json = GSON.toJson(newObject());
        }
    }
```
logcat

```java
	V/AspectRevealerï¹• MainActivity#toJson :: [62 ms]
```

Hugely inspired by and finely minified version of [JakeWharton/hugo](https://github.com/JakeWharton/hugo).

## Todo

- [ ] Sync to mavenCentral
- [ ] Separate jars for annotation and library module
- [ ] Method parameter support to extend its `toString()`

## Download

As noted in Todo, AspectLogger has not been synced to mavenCentral yet; **only supports jcenter for now**. Also, AspectJ is required to actually use it. I thought just adding [gradle-android-aspectj-plugin library](https://github.com/uPhyca/gradle-android-aspectj-plugin) to your project would be the easiest way for set up. (I know all of these setup process sucks and will improve it in the future release).

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.uphyca.gradle:gradle-android-aspectj-plugin:0.9.12'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'android-aspectj'

dependencies {
    compile('com.s_hei.aspectlogger:reveal:0.1.0@aar')
}
```
