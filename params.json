Development started for the purpose of 'revealing' the causes of bugs and erorrs just by simple one annotation. Ironically, `@Reveal` to your methods only does measure their execution time for now.. \r\n\r\n(More functionality and usable annotations will be available in the future release.)\r\n\r\nMainActivity\r\n```java\r\n    @Reveal\r\n    private static void toJson() {\r\n        String json = \"\";\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {\r\n            json = GSON.toJson(newObject());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nlogcat\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\tV/AspectRevealerï¹• MainActivity#toJson :: [62 ms]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHugely inspired by and finely minified version of [JakeWharton/hugo](https://github.com/JakeWharton/hugo).\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n- [ ] Sync to mavenCentral\r\n- [ ] Separate jars for annotation and library module\r\n- [ ] Method parameter support to extend its `toString()`\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nAs noted in Todo, AspectLogger has not been synced to mavenCentral yet; **only supports jcenter for now**. Also, AspectJ is required to actually use it. I thought just adding [gradle-android-aspectj-plugin library](https://github.com/uPhyca/gradle-android-aspectj-plugin) to your project would be the easiest way for set up. (I know all of these setup process sucks and will improve it in the future release).\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\nbuildscript {\r\n  repositories {\r\n    jcenter()\r\n  }\r\n  dependencies {\r\n    classpath 'com.uphyca.gradle:gradle-android-aspectj-plugin:0.9.12'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\r\napply plugin: 'android-aspectj'\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n    compile('com.s_hei.aspectlogger:reveal:0.1.0@aar')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2015 Shohei Shaun Kawano\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
